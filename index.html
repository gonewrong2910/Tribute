        <div id="sec1"> <p>Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, 
            Santa Fe,[12] the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a 
            steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, 
            who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's
             side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson 
             of immigrants from the northcentral Adriatic Marche region of 
             Italy and Catalonia, and on his mother's side, he has primarily
              Italian ancestry.[5] Growing up in a tight-knit, 
              football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the 
              sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older
               brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano 
               and Emanuel Biancucchi, 
            both of whom became professional footballers</p></div>

                        Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario.[571] He has known Roccuzzo
                         since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his 
                         childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football 
                         player.[572]

                        Thiago (born 2012), Mateo (born 2015) and Ciro (born 2018). 
                        To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed the 
                        ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4–0 win 
                        against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy 
                        in an interview two weeks later.[574] Thiago was born in
                         Barcelona on 2 November 2012, with Messi attending the birth
